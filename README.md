# Quests & Tasks 

To run this app you'll need to set the environment variables :

FIREBASE_API_KEY
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
FIREBASE_APP_ID
FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) installed.*


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd taskquest
yarn
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
yarn dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.
